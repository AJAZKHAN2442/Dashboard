# Dashboard
A dashboard is a visual representation of essential information and key performance indicators (KPIs) consolidated in a single, easily accessible interface. Typically used in business or technology contexts, dashboards provide a real-time snapshot of data, allowing users to monitor, analyze, and make informed decisions.
